# distance-measurement-stm32
This is an embedded systems project for interfacing an ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) with an STM32 microcontroller using STM32CubeIDE and the HAL libraries. The measured distance is displayed on a 16x2 LCD in real-time. This project is useful for learning how to use GPIO, timers, and peripheral interfacing on STM32 microcontrollers.
